First of all:
- You'll need a firebase account and a project created at it
- Then you can add your firebase authentication tokens at your env.local file
- Of course you'll need Node.js installed in your computer

Next:
- Install firebase using npm/yarn
- Install react-bootstrap using npm/yarn
- Install react-router-dom using npm/yarn

If I'm not forgetting anything extremely important you should be ready to go.

ps.: If I'm forgetting something just google it.
